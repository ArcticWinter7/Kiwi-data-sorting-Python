regarding the execution times of each sorting method, both seem to have an extremely high ammount of inconsistency.
The bubble sorting method seems to take anywhere from 0.4(2sf) seconds and 0.9(2sf) seconds to execute
the selection sorting method takes between 0.32(3sf) and 0.42(3sf) seconds to execute.
it seems that on average, the selection sorting method is more consistant and executes faster than the bubble sorting method
