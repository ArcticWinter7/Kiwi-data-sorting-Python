regarding the execution times of each sorting method, both seem to have an extremely high ammount of inconsistency.
The bubble sorting method seems to take anywhere from 0.4(2sf) seconds and 0.9(2sf) seconds to execute
the selection sorting method takes between 0.32(3sf) and 0.42(3sf) seconds to execute.
the merge sorting method takes between 0.20(3sf) and 0.24(3sf) to execute, it also does so with a greater cobnsistancy than any other sorting method
it seems that on average, the merge sorting method is more consistant and executes faster than the selection and bubble sorting method, making the merge sorting method the fastest
